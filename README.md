#### Tool for generating MIDI scores using GM (General MIDI) instruments

How to run it:
1. Make sure you have installed the Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0 - https://java.com/en/download/
2. Download the executable from the latest release
3. Run the executable

How to use it:
1. If a MIDI device called 'Gervill' is visible, you can click 'Compose' - this is the default Windows MIDI device for output.
2. If such a device isn't visible, uncheck "MIDI transmitter mode" and click 'Compose'
3. If you want to output the MIDI notes into your DAW instead, install a virtual MIDI cable (loopMIDI is recommended) 
    and then it can be selected as one of the MIDI transmitter options
