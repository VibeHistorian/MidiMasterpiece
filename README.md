# VibeComposer
## Free music generator with MIDI Drag'n'Drop support

#### Quick showcase (first 20 seconds) + adjustments/export into DAW: https://youtu.be/aDGb5QGIvcQ

#### How to use it:
1. Click 'Compose' to hear a preview of a track.

    1a. Make any adjustments you want, then click 'Regenerate' to hear the new changes.

    1b. If you like what you hear, you can enable 'Arrangement' and listen to a full 'arranged' track with varying energy and new variations.

2. Drag'n'Drop into your DAW, or just save it for later.

#### How to run it (on Windows):
1. Make sure you have installed the Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0 - https://java.com/en/download/
2. Download the executable from the latest release https://github.com/VibeHistorian/VibeComposer/releases/tag/v1.5-beta
3. Run the executable
(Note: Linux/Mac users might be able to run it using the .jar instead of the .exe file)


**Note:** if no sound is coming out but the playback slider is moving (MIDI is playing), try unchecking 'MIDI transmitted mode" and clicking 'Regenerate'.

**Note2:** if you want direct playback into your DAW, install a virtual MIDI cable (loopMIDI is recommended) 
    and then it can be selected as one of the MIDI transmitter devices in the dropdown menu.
    
    
For everything else, refer to the old VibeComposer v1.2 user manual: https://github.com/VibeHistorian/VibeComposer/blob/development_master/midimasterpiece/VibeComposer_UserManual.pdf
