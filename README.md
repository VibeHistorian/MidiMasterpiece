#### Example: https://soundcloud.com/vibehistorian/vibecomposer-v17-track-1 (made with VibeComposer v1.7 and free instruments/samples)


#### How to run it (on Windows):
1. Make sure you have installed the Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0 - https://java.com/en/download/
2. Download the executable from the latest release https://github.com/VibeHistorian/VibeComposer/releases/tag/v1.7-beta
3. Run the executable

#### How to run it (on Linux/Mac):
1. Same thing as Windows, but use the JAR (.jar) file instead of the executable (.exe) file.
2. If step 1 doesn't work, it might be necessary to open a terminal in the location where the .jar was downloaded, and use a "java -jar <name of file>.jar" command to run it
3. If step 1 and 2 doesn't work, google is your last hope.

#### How to use it:
1. Click 'Compose' to hear a preview of the song (one measure loop).

    1a. Make any adjustments you want, then click 'Regenerate' to hear the new changes.

    1b. If you like what you hear, you can enable Arrangement by checking 'Arrange' and clicking 'Regenerate' again, 
     which creates a fully 'arranged' track with varying energy levels and new variations.

2. Drag'n'Drop into your DAW, or just save it for later.


**Note:** if no sound is coming out but the playback slider is moving (the song appears to be playing), try unchecking 'MIDI Transmitter Mode" and clicking 'Regenerate', or changing the MIDI device to something else.

**Note2:** if you want direct playback into your DAW, install a virtual MIDI cable (loopMIDI is recommended) 
    and then it can be selected as one of the MIDI transmitter devices in the dropdown menu.
